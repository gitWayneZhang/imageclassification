# Imageclassification, conceptual idea.
Train some images to classify Litter, Overgrown grass and Illegal signs as these are the main categories of Keep Cobb Beautiful project every year.
More categories are possilbe if we collect more pictures. 
Final model can be exported to a mobilnet.v2 for a mobile device application so citizen can use mobile device camera to take and save a picture. The app will automatically categorize the issue and submit a report to County department.
